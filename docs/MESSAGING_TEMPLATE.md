## Language Tips

### ✅ Do Use:
- Action verbs (Transform, Save, Cut, Sleep, Make)
- Specific numbers (Save $5000, Cut 3 weeks, In under an hour)
- Emotional words (Stress, Confidence, Peace of mind, Dream)
- Customer language ("Wildly different quotes" not "Quote variance")
- Questions that resonate ("Tired of X?" "Ready to Y?")

### ❌ Avoid:
- Jargon and buzzwords ("Revolutionary," "Cutting-edge," "Synergy")
- Vague claims ("Better results," "Improved outcomes")
- Company-focused language ("We offer," "Our platform provides")
- Multiple CTAs on same page
- Generic testimonials ("Great product!" with no context)

---

## Test Your Messaging

Show your landing page to 5-10 people from your target audience and ask:

1. **"What does this company do?"**
   - If they can't answer clearly, your solution section needs work

2. **"Who is this for?"**
   - If they don't say "people like me," your problem section needs work

3. **"Would you click the button? Why or why not?"**
   - This reveals if your benefit/CTA is compelling

4. **"What concerns do you have?"**
   - These become objections to address on the page

---

**Remember:** Great landing pages don't just list features. They tell a story that your customer sees themselves in, making the next step feel obvious and risk-free.

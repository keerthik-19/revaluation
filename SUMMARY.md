## 🧪 Test Your Messaging

Show to 5-10 target customers and ask:

1. **"What does this company do?"**
   → Tests clarity of solution

2. **"Who is this for?"**
   → Tests problem/audience fit

3. **"Would you click the button?"**
   → Tests CTA effectiveness

4. **"What concerns do you have?"**
   → Reveals objections to address

---

## 📊 What To Track

Key metrics for optimization:
- **CTA Click Rate** - Primary conversion goal
- **Scroll Depth** - Are they reading everything?
- **Time on Page** - Level of engagement
- **Bounce Rate** - Is message resonating?

---

## 🎯 Why This Framework Works

Traditional landing pages focus on features ("We have AI!") or vague benefits ("Transform your business!"). 

This approach works because it:

1. **Starts with empathy** - "I understand your frustration"
2. **Provides clarity** - "Here's exactly how we solve it"
3. **Paints aspiration** - "Imagine life without that problem"
4. **Removes friction** - "Take this obvious, low-risk next step"
5. **Uses customer language** - Words they'd actually say

The structure follows the proven **Problem-Agitate-Solution** framework with clear benefit statements and a strong call to action.
